      desc: "Born in the lap of the Holy Ganga, at the feet of the Bhootnath Shiva Temple, amidst the forests of the Himalayas, Dhirendra reveals himself as a nature lover and spiritual seeker. Having started his schooling at the tender age of 5, from one of the oldest, most iconic and traditional schools of Rishikesh, Dhirendra believes he was drawn to Yoga by a mystical force as he practiced asanas during the physical education lessons in school. He began to live the yogic way of life from that early age and embraced spirituality as his routines began with worshipping Lord Shiva and the Holy Ganga and continued with practising asanas, eating satvik food and attending music lessons. It was under the able guidance of his Guru Narender Gusain that he was able to leave all his vices and practice Yoga religiously. His dedication was such that there were times that he would practice till his body was sore, and it was around this time that he realized that the external appreciation and praise were pointless and the true meaning of Yoga was the alignment of the body, mind and soul, being able to appreciate himself from within. The next part of his training came under Guru Nalin Sharma, under whom he learned Yogic Philosophy and spiritual growth and finally under Guru Roshan Singh, Dhirendra underwent lessons on personal growth. When his three Gurus thought he was ready, Dhirendra started the Yoga school with one goal - helping other seekers on their yogic journey to explore their full potential.",
